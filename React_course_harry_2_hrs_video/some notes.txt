npx -A tool to run node packages easily without installing binaries.

put anything u want to see in ui inside { }
every component is <div>
App component gives a structure to the website, inside app component we put all other components.

props are js objects which we r passing from parent to child component

<Header title={"My Todo List"} val={45} /> //calling  functional component as html tag, passing props as html attribute, pass literal values inside { }

{Header({ title: "My Todo List", val: 78 })}
//calling funcitonal component as funciton and passing props as objects as arguments - avoid this method

//Header.propTypes - for typechecking
//Header.defaultProps - provides default props in case not passed as argument.
