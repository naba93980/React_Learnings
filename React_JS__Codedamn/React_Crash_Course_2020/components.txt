everything in webpage are components

eg. Home.js -> Header.js + Content.js
    Blog.js -> Header.js + Comments.js + Footer.js

The function App in App.js represents a component

components are of 2 types :

  -  class components
  -  functional components

all custom components starts with capital letter, if u start with small letter then react would interpret it as html tag and not as a component tag
