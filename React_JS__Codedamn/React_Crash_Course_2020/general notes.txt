JS = UI(JSX) + Logic.

Every function returns one div component which is rendered inside another div component.

React converts JSX tags into HTML DOM element tree.
ReactDOM renders those generated HTML DOM element tree.

eg. ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById("root"));

React converts <App/> jsx element into HTML element tree and ReactDOM renders that generated HTML tree as child element tree of id=root element.


valid jsx elements - null, numbers, HTML, strings, arrays

React code must not use DOM api like document.getElementById() etc. - it is not 'React'ive way, we should use React DOM api to manipulate DOM
